Jupyter Notebooks with a proposed solution to the following exercise by Prof. Andrea Shindler during the 2023 Summer School on Methods of Effective Field Theory and Lattice Field Theory @ Physikzentrum Bad Honnef

### Exercise 12: The nucleon-nucleon 2-point function

#### The nucleon-nucleon 2-point function data shared via email are divided in directories: each directory contains the 2-point function for a given gauge ensemble. The name of the directory contains information about the lattice size and the κ values for the Nf = 2 light sector (κud) and for the strange quark (κs). Additioanl information about the 16, 20 and 28 ensembles can be found in "https://www.jldg.org/ildg-data/CPPACS+JLQCDconfig.html". For the large volumes ensembles consult "http://www.jldg.org/ildg-data/PACSCSconfig.html".

 • Calculate the euclidean time dependence of each correlator and plot them.

 • Calculate the effective mass of each correlator as a function of Euclidean time and plot them.

 • Perform a constant fit where the effective mass plateaus and plot the extracted mass as a function of the pion mass and pion mass squared (pion masses can be found on the links above).
 
 • Plot the extracted mass from the previous analysis as a function of the lattice spacing squared (values of the lattice spacings can be found in the links above).
